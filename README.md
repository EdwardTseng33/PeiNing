# Munea (沐寧)

> 會記得你，也在乎你在乎的人。

**Munea (沐寧)** is an iOS-first AI health-care companion app: a personal AI butler that lives in the phone, talks like a warm presence, remembers the person over time, helps with daily health routines, and keeps family connected when care should not be carried alone.

The first product starts as an App Store app, then extends toward a wider smart-health service layer: family dashboards, health-data connections, proactive care workflows, and future hardware / home-care integrations.

Munea is positioned as **smart care and companionship, not medical software**. It does not diagnose, treat, prescribe, or replace clinicians.

---

## Product Direction

- **Core user:** people who want daily AI health-care companionship, plus the family members who care about them.
- **First platform:** iOS first, Android later.
- **First experience:** open the app and use `聊聊`: a fullscreen butler face with voice, subtitles, memory, and gentle proactive care.
- **MVP scope:** Mandarin voice companionship, health-routine reminders, family interaction, emotional safety referral, onboarding, and a family dashboard.
- **Future moat:** Taiwanese voice support, richer avatar engines, deeper memory, health-data integrations, and hardware-assisted care services.

The working north star is an AI health-care companion for everyday life. Older-adult care is an important first scenario, not the product boundary. Munea should feel like a capable 30-35-year-old butler: warm, attentive, calm, and useful without making the user feel labeled.

## What Makes Munea Different

1. **Memory with boundaries**
   Munea remembers names, habits, preferences, family context, life stories, and recent emotional signals, but uses that memory to support daily life rather than diagnose.

2. **Family-aware care**
   Munea is designed for both individual use and family care. The person using Munea and the person checking in may be different, but the product should keep both sides calm, informed, and connected.

3. **Three brains, one face**
   The live conversation, background care planning, and safety referral logic are separated so the app can feel responsive while still becoming personal over time.

4. **Proactive, but iOS-realistic**
   When the app is closed, Munea reaches out through iOS push notifications. When opened, it becomes a full voice conversation with a talking face.

5. **Non-medical by design**
   Medication features are reminders, not advice. Emotional support is companionship, not therapy. Crisis handling routes to family or proper hotlines such as 1925 / 119.

## Current Prototype Status

As of 2026-06-28, this repo is no longer just pre-build planning. It contains a runnable local prototype:

- landing page, onboarding, app home, and family dashboard
- fullscreen butler-face conversation screen
- six selectable characters
- Gemini-backed prototype chat and TTS flow
- local memory demo through `engine/user_profile.json`
- Munea-style visual system and app shell

Run locally:

```bat
run-munea-app.bat
```

Or:

```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
py engine/server.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8200
```

Secrets are expected in `engine/.env.local`, which is ignored by Git.

## Architecture Snapshot

| Layer | Purpose | Current direction |
|---|---|---|
| Reflex brain | Live voice conversation | Gemini 3.1 Flash Live direction; local demo currently uses Gemini generation + TTS |
| Butler brain | Memory, schedules, context, daily care | Background rules + cheap AI when judgment is needed |
| Guardian brain | Crisis / anomaly referral | Family notification and hotline referral, not medical judgment |
| Face | Fullscreen butler presence | 2D/static now; Ditto / LiveAvatar PoCs decide real lip-sync path |
| App shell | App Store delivery | Capacitor iOS shell planned; microphone bridge is the next go/no-go |

Critical principle: **conversation continuity beats face fidelity**. If avatar rendering is slow or unavailable, the app should keep the voice conversation alive and degrade the face gracefully.

---

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Validate the hard gates

- Capacitor microphone bridge on iPhone
- avatar FPS / latency retest on proper GPU setup
- App Store privacy and non-medical copy review

### Phase 1 — First TestFlight path

- real-time voice loop
- basic butler memory
- fullscreen face state machine
- child-led onboarding
- health-routine reminder flow
- family dashboard skeleton

### Phase 2 — Product depth

- durable database-backed memory
- Apple Health / health-data connections
- push notification workflows
- safety referral flows
- points / subscription system
- six-character production quality

### Phase 3 — Service expansion

- Taiwanese voice pipeline
- richer avatar rendering
- B2B2C care partnerships
- optional hardware and home-care extensions

For current planning truth, read these first:

1. `docs/00-總綱-從這裡開始.md`
2. `docs/SPEC-沐寧-v1-2026-06-28.md`
3. `STATUS.md`
4. `BACKLOG.md`

Some older documents still preserve research history and may contain superseded assumptions, especially around GPT-Realtime, full self-hosting language, old character names, and pre-6/28 screen structure. The SPEC file is the current authority.

## Development Notes

- Windows/local prototype: use `run-munea-app.bat`.
- iOS packaging: requires macOS, Xcode, Apple Developer access, and Capacitor.
- The local development folder may still contain historical `PeiNing/peining` path names; GitHub and product naming are now **Munea / 沐寧**.
- Do not commit `engine/.env.local`.

## Compliance Line

Munea is a companion and life-reminder product. It does not provide medical diagnosis, treatment, prescriptions, dosage advice, or psychological counseling. Health concerns should be handled by qualified professionals; emergencies should be routed to appropriate services such as 119 or 1925.
