# Munea Supabase Setup

Updated: 2026-06-29

This folder documents the first production database path for Munea.

Current status:

- Supabase account exists.
- Cloud project still needs to be created or connected.
- Repo now contains the initial SQL schema draft at `supabase/sql/001_initial_munea_schema.sql`.
- Supabase CLI is not installed in this Windows environment yet, so this is a SQL Editor-ready schema, not an official migration history entry.

## Recommended Project

Use one Supabase project for the first TestFlight backend.

Recommended settings:

- Region: closest stable region to Taiwan users, likely Northeast Asia if available.
- Database password: generated strong password, stored in a password manager only.
- Auth: email/password or magic link first; Apple Sign In later for App Store polish.
- Exposed schema: `public`.
- Data API: if public tables are not automatically exposed, grant access explicitly and keep RLS enabled.

## First SQL Setup

1. Open Supabase dashboard.
2. Create or open the Munea project.
3. Go to SQL Editor.
4. Paste and run:

```text
supabase/sql/001_initial_munea_schema.sql
```

This schema creates:

- `accounts`
- `account_members`
- `persons`
- `family_groups`
- `family_memberships`
- `companion_profiles`
- `routine_reminders`
- `voice_sessions`
- `conversation_summaries`
- `safety_events`
- `subscription_ledger`
- `usage_ledger`
- `privacy_requests`
- `audit_events`

All public tables have RLS enabled. `anon` is explicitly revoked. `authenticated` gets table grants, then row access is restricted by account membership policies.

## RLS Model

Main rule:

```text
auth.uid() must match account_members.user_id for the row's account_id.
```

This means family data is separated by `account_id`. A logged-in user can only see rows for accounts where they are an active member.

Important:

- Do not use `user_metadata` for authorization.
- Do not expose `service_role` to the app.
- Do not grant `anon` access to user data tables.
- Subscription and usage ledger writes should be server-side only.
- Data export and account deletion jobs should be server-side only.

## Bootstrap Note

The first account/member/person creation should be handled by backend onboarding logic using server credentials, not by letting any authenticated user create arbitrary account rows directly.

For the local prototype, JSON files still exist:

- `engine/app_profile_store.json`
- `engine/companion_profile.json`
- `engine/billing_store.json`
- `engine/privacy_requests.json`

The migration path is:

```text
local JSON prototype -> Supabase tables -> backend API reads/writes Supabase
```

## Backend Adapter Status

The repo now includes `engine/supabase_adapter.py`.

Current behavior:

- Default backend remains JSON fallback.
- Set `MUNEA_DATABASE_PROVIDER=supabase` plus Supabase URL, service role key, account id, and person id to enable the adapter.
- `/healthz`, `/app-profile`, and `/companion-profile` expose backend status so we can verify whether the process is using JSON fallback or Supabase.
- `/app-profile` can aggregate `accounts`, `persons`, `family_groups`, `family_memberships`, and `companion_profiles` from Supabase when env is complete.

Required backend-only environment values:

```text
MUNEA_DATABASE_PROVIDER=supabase
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
MUNEA_SUPABASE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
MUNEA_SUPABASE_PERSON_ID=...
MUNEA_SUPABASE_FAMILY_GROUP_ID=...
```

Security rule:

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must only exist in backend environment files or hosting secrets.
- It must never be copied into `web/`, Capacitor bundles, public JavaScript, screenshots, or chat.

## Environment Variables

Use the template:

```text
docs/supabase/munea-env.example.txt
```

Never commit real Supabase secrets. The publishable/anon key can be used by a public client only after RLS is correct. The service role key must stay on the backend only.

## After SQL Runs

Run these checks in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
select tablename, rowsecurity
from pg_tables
where schemaname = 'public'
order by tablename;
```

Every Munea table should show `rowsecurity = true`.

Then run:

```sql
select table_name, privilege_type, grantee
from information_schema.role_table_grants
where table_schema = 'public'
  and grantee in ('anon', 'authenticated')
order by table_name, grantee, privilege_type;
```

Expected:

- `authenticated` has normal table privileges.
- `anon` should not have access to Munea user data tables.

## Next Implementation Step

Once the Supabase project is created:

1. Add env values to local backend environment.
2. Add a Supabase database adapter in `engine/`.
3. `/app-profile`, `/companion-profile`, `/entitlements`, `/privacy-export`, and `/account-deletion` now have Supabase adapter paths behind the `MUNEA_DATABASE_PROVIDER=supabase` feature flag, with JSON fallback preserved.
4. Keep JSON fallback for local offline prototype only.
