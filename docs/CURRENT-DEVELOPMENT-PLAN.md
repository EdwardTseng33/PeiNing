# Munea Current Development Plan

> Updated: 2026-06-29
> Purpose: current execution plan for turning the runnable prototype into a first TestFlight path.

## Current Truth

- Product core: **AI health care + family interaction + `聊聊`**.
- First market wedge: family/older-adult care, but Munea is not an "elderly-only app."
- Language priority: **Taiwan Mandarin first, English second**.
- Taiwanese Hokkien: research only for now; no v1/v2 commitment and no self-trained language model.
- Voice direction: Gemini 3.1 Flash Live direction, subject to live API integration testing.
- App delivery: iOS first through Capacitor; Android later.
- Compliance line: companion and life reminder, not diagnosis, treatment, prescription, or therapy.

## Progress Snapshot

| Track | Status | Progress |
|---|---|---:|
| Product direction / PRD | Current authority exists in README + SPEC | 85-90% |
| Runnable web prototype | Home, status, chat, family, settings, onboarding, landing | 65-70% |
| Prototype AI engine | Local Python Gemini chat/TTS demo works | 35-45% |
| iOS shell | Capacitor config scaffolded; native project still requires Mac/Xcode | 5-10% |
| Data backend | Local JSON demo only | 10-15% |
| Real-time avatar | Avatar Runtime contract added; engine PoCs still pending | 25-35% |
| First TestFlight path | Not ready yet | 30-35% |

## 2026-06-29 Update

- Added the first mobile microphone bridge path.
- Added `POST /voice-note` as a backend validation endpoint for recorded audio payloads.
- Updated smoke tests so the audio payload route is checked in full API verification.
- Added `docs/MOBILE-VOICE-BRIDGE.md` for iOS handoff and next device test steps.
- Ran local `npm install`, full smoke test, and Capacitor Doctor.
- Moved product architecture and Avatar development forward.
- Replaced `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with the current product/service architecture.
- Added `docs/PRODUCT-ARCHITECTURE-AVATAR-FIRST-PLAN.md`.
- Added frontend `MuneaAvatarRuntime` as the future insertion point for 2D viseme, Ditto, and LiveAvatar.
- Added Avatar engine modes and the first mock 2D viseme mouth-state layer.
- Added `docs/AVATAR-RUNTIME-QA.md` for local and iPhone visual QA.
- Added `docs/RUNPOD-AVATAR-POC-SCHEDULE.md` to anchor Ditto retest and first LiveAvatar benchmark around the RunPod console.
- Added `docs/TECH-STACK-EVALUATION-2026-06-29.md` to review the full product stack and confirm the best path.
- Added `docs/VOICE-PROVIDER-ADAPTER.md` and the first `window.MuneaVoiceProvider` / `/voice-session` contract.
- Split companion identity into user-chosen display name plus selectable character template, and redesigned Settings around product domains instead of duplicated role rows.
- Reduced Home visual density, redesigned the chat entry module, and split thumbnail avatar assets from fullscreen chat avatar assets.
- Reframed Chat as S2S call-first: visible text is state feedback only; transcript/captions are future accessibility options, not the default product surface.
- Added a shared browser-side Companion Profile contract so onboarding, Home, Chat, and Settings use the same `templateId` and `displayName`.
- Added local backend `/companion-profile` persistence as the bridge from prototype local storage to the future account database.
- Added `engine/app_profile_store.json` plus `/app-profile` so account, family group, primary person, and companion profiles share one local store before the production database move.
- Added App Store production readiness baseline: local `/entitlements`, `/subscription-event`, `/privacy-export`, `/account-deletion`, `/healthz`, `engine/billing_store.json`, `engine/privacy_requests.json`, and `docs/APP-STORE-PRODUCTION-READINESS.md`.
- Added Supabase production database bootstrap files: `supabase/sql/001_initial_munea_schema.sql`, `docs/supabase/SETUP.md`, and `docs/supabase/munea-env.example.txt`.
- Added `docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE-v1.md` to lock the backend API, data, RLS, subscription, admin, and North Star analytics plan before deeper feature work.

## Tech Stack Verdict

- Keep Capacitor + Web Core for first iOS TestFlight.
- Add a Voice Provider Adapter instead of hard-coding one Gemini model/version.
- Move data from local JSON to Postgres + RLS before multi-user testing.
- Keep Avatar Runtime and 2D viseme as the first TestFlight-safe face path.
- Keep Ditto / LiveAvatar behind measured RunPod PoC gates.
- Implement push and subscription/ledger foundations earlier than visual polish.

## Sprint 1-B: Handoff Baseline

Goal: make the repo safe for continued development.

- [x] Align README and SPEC to the current product direction.
- [x] Align language strategy to Taiwan Mandarin first, English second.
- [x] Mark old gpt-realtime / Taiwanese Hokkien assumptions as historical.
- [x] Fix `/open` role fallback.
- [x] Remove stale frontend id references.
- [x] Add repeatable smoke test script.
- [x] Add minimal Capacitor scaffold.

Definition of done:
- `git status -sb` is clean.
- Python files compile.
- JSON files parse.
- Frontend id refs are not broken.
- Static preview reaches `聊聊` without console errors.
- `/open` and `/chat` can be tested when the local engine is running.

## Sprint 1-C: Capacitor / iOS Shell

Goal: prepare the iOS app wrapper.

Work items:
- [x] Run `npm install`.
- [x] Verify Capacitor CLI and iOS package with `npx cap doctor`.
- [ ] On macOS with Xcode: run `npm run cap:add:ios`.
- [ ] Verify app opens the bundled `web/` shell.
- [ ] Add iOS usage descriptions for microphone and future HealthKit.
- [ ] Confirm WKWebView can load local assets and play audio after user gesture.

Go/no-go:
- iPhone can open Munea shell from Xcode.
- Existing static app UI works inside Capacitor.

## Sprint 1-D: Microphone Bridge PoC

Goal: validate the riskiest native bridge before building too much around it.

Work items:
- [ ] Add a minimal microphone test screen or hidden diagnostic route.
- [ ] Request iOS microphone permission.
- [ ] Capture microphone audio in WKWebView / Capacitor.
- [ ] Confirm audio can be passed to the voice layer.
- [x] Add backend `/voice-note` bridge endpoint for captured audio payloads.
- [x] Add smoke-test coverage for the voice payload route.
- [ ] Measure start latency and permission friction.

Go/no-go:
- If microphone capture is stable on device, proceed to Gemini Live loop.
- If unstable, evaluate native audio capture plugin or a small native bridge.

## Sprint 1-E: Gemini Live Voice Loop

Goal: shift from current POST-based demo to real-time speech interaction.

Work items:
- [x] Define `MuneaVoiceProvider` adapter.
- [ ] Confirm Gemini Live / Interactions API shape and auth model.
- [ ] Define frontend audio stream format.
- [ ] Build smallest loop: listen -> send -> receive voice -> play.
- [ ] Preserve fallback to typed/static demo mode.
- [ ] Track latency: first response, interruption, and recovery after network failure.

Go/no-go:
- Taiwan Mandarin voice feels natural enough for a first TestFlight.
- Latency is acceptable before avatar integration.

## Sprint 1-E2: Avatar Runtime MVP

Goal: move real-time Avatar development forward without blocking on GPU PoC.

Work items:
- [x] Define frontend Avatar Runtime contract.
- [x] Route idle/listening/thinking/speaking through the runtime.
- [x] Route character switching through the runtime.
- [x] Expose `window.MuneaAvatarRuntime` for development diagnostics.
- [x] Add avatar engine mode enum: `static-css`, `2d-viseme`, `ditto`, `liveavatar`.
- [x] Add a mock avatar engine that consumes audio duration and state events.
- [x] Add first 2D viseme / mouth-state PoC.
- [x] Add mobile visual QA checklist for idle/listen/think/speak.
- [ ] Test idle/listen/think/speak on iPhone WKWebView.

Go/no-go:
- If 2D viseme is smooth on iPhone, use it as the first TestFlight avatar path.
- If Ditto / LiveAvatar PoC clears fps and cold-start gates, attach it behind the same runtime.

## Sprint 1-E3: RunPod Avatar PoC

Goal: turn the prior Ditto RunPod test and the unscheduled LiveAvatar benchmark into measurable go/no-go gates.

Work items:
- [x] Record RunPod console as the operating reference: `https://console.runpod.io/pods`.
- [x] Create a unified Ditto / LiveAvatar RunPod schedule and measurement form.
- [ ] Reopen or recreate the prior Ditto RTX 4090 pod and run online fps retest.
- [ ] Schedule LiveAvatar first benchmark on H100/H200 80GB+ single-card FP8 path.
- [ ] Record fps, cold start, VRAM, output path, quality verdict, and stop pod immediately after testing.

Go/no-go:
- Ditto online `>=25 it/s` with acceptable mouth sync: promote `ditto` from reserved mode to integration candidate.
- LiveAvatar `>=40 fps` and cold start can be hidden: keep `liveavatar` as premium candidate.
- Otherwise keep first TestFlight on `2d-viseme` + `static-css` fallback.

## Sprint 1-F: Data And Safety Foundation

Goal: stop relying on local JSON before multi-user work starts.

Work items:
- [ ] Choose backend database stack.
- [ ] Implement Profile and Memory tables first.
- [ ] Define `family_group_id` and permission model.
- [ ] Add conversation memory and retention policy without making raw transcripts the default user-facing surface.
- [x] Persist prototype companion template/name across onboarding, Home, Chat, and Settings.
- [x] Add local backend companion profile load/save route.
- [x] Add local account/family/person/companion profile store placeholder.
- [x] Add local subscription entitlement and usage ledger placeholder.
- [x] Add App Store production readiness checklist and API safety baseline.
- [x] Add deletion/export requirements and local data-rights API contracts.
- [x] Draft Supabase Postgres schema and RLS policy baseline.
- [x] Document Backend Architecture v1, including admin console and North Star dashboard plan.
- [ ] Create/live-link Supabase project and run initial SQL.
- [ ] Convert SQL draft into official Supabase migration after CLI/MCP authentication.

## Sprint 1-G: App Store Subscription And Trust Layer

Goal: make the product safe enough to move toward TestFlight and paid subscription design.

Work items:
- [x] Add `/entitlements` as backend source of truth for paid feature gates.
- [x] Add `/subscription-event` placeholder for StoreKit / App Store Server Notifications / RevenueCat webhook flow.
- [x] Add `/healthz` service contract check.
- [x] Add request-size, audio MIME, audio-size, and safe API error guardrails.
- [x] Add `/privacy-export` and `/account-deletion` contracts for App Store account/data rights readiness.
- [ ] Choose StoreKit 2 direct validation vs RevenueCat for first paid launch.
- [ ] Configure App Store Connect subscription products and restore-purchase UX.
- [ ] Implement signed subscription event verification in production backend.
- [ ] Add account deletion and data export flow before App Review.

## Immediate Priority Order

1. Keep docs aligned to README + SPEC + `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Lock the product architecture and Avatar Runtime contract.
3. Keep the runnable prototype stable with smoke tests.
4. Build Avatar Runtime MVP and 2D viseme fallback path.
5. Finish Capacitor shell setup and validate microphone on a real iPhone.
