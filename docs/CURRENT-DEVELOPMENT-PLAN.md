# Munea Current Development Plan

> Updated: 2026-06-30
> Purpose: current execution plan for turning the runnable prototype into a first TestFlight path.

## Current Truth

- Product core: **AI health care + family interaction + `聊聊`**.
- First market wedge: family/older-adult care, but Munea is not an "elderly-only app."
- Language priority: **Taiwan Mandarin first, English second**.
- Taiwanese Hokkien: research only for now; no v1/v2 commitment and no self-trained language model.
- Voice direction: Gemini 3.1 Flash Live direction, subject to live API integration testing.
- App delivery: iOS first through Capacitor; Android later.
- Compliance line: companion and life reminder, not diagnosis, treatment, prescription, or therapy.

## Progress Snapshot

| Track | Status | Progress |
|---|---|---:|
| Product direction / PRD | Current authority exists in README + SPEC | 85-90% |
| Runnable web prototype | Home, status, chat, family, settings, onboarding, landing | 65-70% |
| Prototype AI engine | Local Python Gemini chat/TTS demo works | 35-45% |
| iOS shell | Capacitor config scaffolded; native project still requires Mac/Xcode | 5-10% |
| Data backend | Supabase schema/seed + analytics foundation exists; backend env loader and doctor added; live env wiring pending | 35-45% |
| Real-time avatar | Avatar Runtime now consumes backend `/avatar-session`; engine PoCs still pending | 35-45% |
| First TestFlight path | Not ready yet | 30-35% |

## 2026-06-30 Update

- Added developer-only AI context diagnostics in Settings, visible through local developer mode or `?debug=ai`.
- The diagnostics panel shows persona template, relationship rapport, Guardian risk, memory count, perception domains, tone overrides, and compact raw diagnostic JSON.
- Connected `/voice-session`, `/chat`, `/voice-note`, and `/butler/post-turn` responses to the latest `aiContext` display.
- Added a manual `/persona/context` refresh so developers can inspect persona + relationship state without storing raw transcript analytics.
- Verified that normal mode hides the panel and `?debug=ai` shows it in Settings.

## 2026-07-01 Update

- Locked the subscription ladder as Free / Plus / Premium / Concierge.
- Added `docs/BILLING-CREDITS-ENTITLEMENT-v1.md` as the source of truth for plan names, entitlement gates, credits direction, deduction order, service architecture, prior-plan review, and future product ids.
- Added `supabase/sql/006_billing_credits_foundation.sql` for `entitlement_policy_versions`, `credit_wallets`, `credit_transactions`, and `credit_ledger`.
- Added the first local runtime credits API: `/credits/balance`, `/credits/grant`, and `/credits/consume`, backed by `engine/credits_store.json`.
- Connected `/avatar-session` to the credits deduction path: monthly premium Avatar allowance first, purchased/included credits for overage, then graceful fallback to `2d-viseme`.
- Clarified that subscriptions should protect the trust-building base experience, while credits should only apply to expensive or bursty add-ons such as premium Avatar/GPU minutes.

## 2026-06-29 Update

- Added the first mobile microphone bridge path.
- Added `POST /voice-note` as a backend validation endpoint for recorded audio payloads.
- Updated smoke tests so the audio payload route is checked in full API verification.
- Added `docs/MOBILE-VOICE-BRIDGE.md` for iOS handoff and next device test steps.
- Ran local `npm install`, full smoke test, and Capacitor Doctor.
- Moved product architecture and Avatar development forward.
- Replaced `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with the current product/service architecture.
- Added `docs/PRODUCT-ARCHITECTURE-AVATAR-FIRST-PLAN.md`.
- Added frontend `MuneaAvatarRuntime` as the future insertion point for 2D viseme, Ditto, and LiveAvatar.
- Added Avatar engine modes and the first mock 2D viseme mouth-state layer.
- Added `docs/AVATAR-RUNTIME-QA.md` for local and iPhone visual QA.
- Added `docs/RUNPOD-AVATAR-POC-SCHEDULE.md` to anchor Ditto retest and first LiveAvatar benchmark around the RunPod console.
- Added `docs/TECH-STACK-EVALUATION-2026-06-29.md` to review the full product stack and confirm the best path.
- Added `docs/VOICE-PROVIDER-ADAPTER.md` and the first `window.MuneaVoiceProvider` / `/voice-session` contract.
- Split companion identity into user-chosen display name plus selectable character template, and redesigned Settings around product domains instead of duplicated role rows.
- Reduced Home visual density, redesigned the chat entry module, and split thumbnail avatar assets from fullscreen chat avatar assets.
- Reframed Chat as S2S call-first: visible text is state feedback only; transcript/captions are future accessibility options, not the default product surface.
- Added a shared browser-side Companion Profile contract so onboarding, Home, Chat, and Settings use the same `templateId` and `displayName`.
- Added local backend `/companion-profile` persistence as the bridge from prototype local storage to the future account database.
- Added `engine/app_profile_store.json` plus `/app-profile` so account, family group, primary person, and companion profiles share one local store before the production database move.
- Added App Store production readiness baseline: local `/entitlements`, `/subscription-event`, `/privacy-export`, `/account-deletion`, `/healthz`, `engine/billing_store.json`, `engine/privacy_requests.json`, and `docs/APP-STORE-PRODUCTION-READINESS.md`.
- Added Supabase production database bootstrap files: `supabase/sql/001_initial_munea_schema.sql`, `docs/supabase/SETUP.md`, and `docs/supabase/munea-env.example.txt`.
- Added `docs/BACKEND-ARCHITECTURE-v1.md` to lock the backend API, data, RLS, subscription, admin, and North Star analytics plan before deeper feature work.
- Added `engine/supabase_adapter.py` and wired companion profile load/save through a Supabase-ready adapter with JSON fallback.
- Extended the Supabase adapter so `/app-profile` can aggregate account, person, family group, family membership, and companion profile data when Supabase env is configured.
- Extended the Supabase adapter so `/entitlements`, subscription/usage ledger mapping, `/privacy-export`, and `/account-deletion` request creation can use Supabase when backend env is configured, with JSON fallback preserved.
- Added `supabase/sql/002_demo_bootstrap.sql` and demo env ids so a real Supabase project can be seeded for first backend adapter testing.
- Added `/avatar-session` as the backend contract for Avatar runtime selection, premium entitlement gating, `2d-viseme` fallback, and Avatar minute usage recording.
- Connected the frontend Avatar Runtime to backend `/avatar-session` so Chat startup consumes the backend-selected runtime mode instead of relying only on local browser choice.
- Added `?debug=avatar` runtime diagnostics and smoke coverage for the frontend Avatar session bridge.
- Added backend `engine/.env.local` loading plus `npm run supabase:doctor` / `npm run supabase:doctor:live` so Supabase wiring can be checked without exposing secrets.
- Added `supabase/sql/003_analytics_admin_foundation.sql`, `/product-event`, and token-gated `/admin/north-star` as the first North Star/Admin MVP data contract.
- Connected the web prototype to `/product-event` for safe Chat, Voice, Avatar, and routine-completion analytics without sending transcript text.
- Added `/account-bootstrap` as the backend-owned contract for creating account/member/person/family/companion rows after Supabase Auth or Apple Sign-In.
- Connected onboarding/settings to the account bootstrap contract with a one-time frontend bootstrap flag. Local JSON mode now creates the prototype account graph from the selected companion profile; Supabase mode fails safely with `auth_user_required` until verified Auth exists.
- Added `docs/AUTH-ONBOARDING-ARCHITECTURE-v1.md` to lock progressive onboarding, guest mode, v1 auth providers, registration fields, and the future Supabase Auth bridge. v1 providers are Sign in with Apple, Google, and email magic link/OTP fallback; Facebook is intentionally out of v1.
- Added browser Auth Bridge v0: `web/src/auth.js` exposes `window.MuneaAuth` for Apple, Google, email magic link/OTP, guest mode, sign-out, and Bearer-token API headers when a Supabase session exists. `web/src/auth-config.example.js` documents publishable-key-only browser configuration.
- Added local-only developer mode foundation: `MUNEA_DEV_CONFIG` can auto sign-in, skip onboarding, and mark all developer/test events as analytics-excluded. North Star summaries now exclude developer/internal/test/QA/ops events and configured excluded ids.
- Added Settings account UI foundation: guest/signed-in/developer status card, Apple/Google/email sign-in sheet, sign-out control, and developer-mode entry when local bypass is allowed.
- Documented the AI model boundary: the "three brains" are product responsibility layers, not three fixed models. Reflex is real-time conversation, Butler is background care context, Guardian is safety/referral, and Ditto/LiveAvatar are face engines.
- Added backend Auth verification foundation: `/auth-status` validates bearer-token auth context, and Supabase `/account-bootstrap` derives `auth.users.id` from verified auth instead of trusting a body-supplied id.
- Added `docs/AI-SERVICE-DESIGN-v1.md` to define Munea's AI service moat: three-brain model selection, effort profiles, long-term memory lifecycle, perception layer, Wisdom Lens, Guardian policy, and MVP implementation order.
- Added `engine/model_router.py` plus `/ai/brain-status`, `/memory/extract`, `/memory/retrieve`, and `/guardian/evaluate` contracts so Butler and Guardian can be tested before live model/provider wiring.
- Added `supabase/sql/004_ai_memory_service_foundation.sql` for `memory_items`, `perception_snapshots`, and `ai_brain_runs`.
- Added Supabase adapter support for `memory_items`, so `/memory/extract?action=store` and `/memory/retrieve` can use the production database path when env is configured, with JSON fallback preserved.
- Expanded Perception Layer from a movie example into a domain-aware topic framework for books, travel, outings, exercise, finance, video entertainment, music/audio, food, news, and wisdom/reflection, with anti-fabrication rules for recommendations.
- Added `/perception/snapshot` plus Supabase adapter path for `perception_snapshots`, giving time/weather/topic/current-fact providers a shared storage contract.

## Tech Stack Verdict

- Keep Capacitor + Web Core for first iOS TestFlight.
- Add a Voice Provider Adapter instead of hard-coding one Gemini model/version.
- Move data from local JSON to Postgres + RLS before multi-user testing.
- Keep Avatar Runtime and 2D viseme as the first TestFlight-safe face path.
- Keep Ditto / LiveAvatar behind measured RunPod PoC gates.
- Implement push and subscription/ledger foundations earlier than visual polish.

## Sprint 1-D: Microphone Bridge PoC

Goal: validate the riskiest native bridge before building too much around it.

Work items:
- [ ] Add a minimal microphone test screen or hidden diagnostic route.
- [ ] Request iOS microphone permission.
- [ ] Capture microphone audio in WKWebView / Capacitor.
- [ ] Confirm audio can be passed to the voice layer.
- [x] Add backend `/voice-note` bridge endpoint for captured audio payloads.
- [x] Add smoke-test coverage for the voice payload route.
- [ ] Measure start latency and permission friction.

Go/no-go:
- If microphone capture is stable on device, proceed to Gemini Live loop.
- If unstable, evaluate native audio capture plugin or a small native bridge.

## Sprint 1-E: Gemini Live Voice Loop

Goal: shift from current POST-based demo to real-time speech interaction.

Work items:
- [x] Define `MuneaVoiceProvider` adapter.
- [ ] Confirm Gemini Live / Interactions API shape and auth model.
- [ ] Define frontend audio stream format.
- [ ] Build smallest loop: listen -> send -> receive voice -> play.
- [ ] Preserve fallback to typed/static demo mode.
- [ ] Track latency: first response, interruption, and recovery after network failure.

Go/no-go:
- Taiwan Mandarin voice feels natural enough for a first TestFlight.
- Latency is acceptable before avatar integration.

## Sprint 1-E2: Avatar Runtime MVP

Goal: move real-time Avatar development forward without blocking on GPU PoC.

Work items:

- If Ditto / LiveAvatar PoC clears fps and cold-start gates, attach it behind the same runtime.

## Sprint 1-E3: RunPod Avatar PoC

Goal: turn the prior Ditto RunPod test and the unscheduled LiveAvatar benchmark into measurable go/no-go gates.

Work items:
- [x] Record RunPod console as the operating reference: `https://console.runpod.io/pods`.
- [x] Create a unified Ditto / LiveAvatar RunPod schedule and measurement form.
- [ ] Reopen or recreate the prior Ditto RTX 4090 pod and run online fps retest.
- [ ] Schedule LiveAvatar first benchmark on H100/H200 80GB+ single-card FP8 path.
- [ ] Record fps, cold start, VRAM, output path, quality verdict, and stop pod immediately after testing.

Go/no-go:
- Ditto online `>=25 it/s` with acceptable mouth sync: promote `ditto` from reserved mode to integration candidate.
- LiveAvatar `>=40 fps` and cold start can be hidden: keep `liveavatar` as premium candidate.
