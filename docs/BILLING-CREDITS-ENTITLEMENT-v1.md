# Munea Billing, Credits, And Entitlement v1

> Updated: 2026-07-01
> Scope: subscription tier names, App Store entitlement, credits wallet direction, usage/cost ledger, and the first service architecture for paid Munea.

## Decision

Munea will use this subscription ladder:

```text
Free -> Plus -> Premium -> Concierge
```

User-facing labels:

| Plan id | English label | Chinese label | Product role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `free` | Munea Free | 免費版 | Trial and basic companion access |
| `plus` | Munea Plus | Plus 進階版 | More daily utility, family support, and higher voice/AI allowance |
| `premium` | Munea Premium | Premium 尊享版 | Premium AI care features, deeper memory, and real-time Avatar allowance |
| `concierge` | Munea Concierge | Concierge 專屬照護版 | Highest-touch service layer for heavy Avatar, family care, priority support, and future hardware/service bundles |

`Concierge` is intentional. It should feel like a dedicated care companion and service layer, not a gamer-style, storage-style, or generic "Ultra" plan.

## Previous Planning Review

The repo already had several billing directions before this decision:

| Prior file | Earlier direction | Current interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/商業模式-點數制-v2-2026-06-27.md` | Freemium + subscription + credits; CFO warning that basic chat should not feel metered | Keep the warning. Basic companionship should not feel like every sentence costs coins. |
| `docs/定案-商業模式與開發路線圖-2026-06-27.md` | Four paid/credit buckets, one wallet, dynamic face usage consumes credits | Keep the two-bucket wallet idea, but revise plan names and avoid making credits the whole product identity. |
| `docs/商業模式-v3-成本現實與訂價修正-2026-06-27.md` | Real-time voice/avatar cost can break unlimited pricing if not gated | Keep cost guardrails through usage ledger, allowance, fallback, and credits. |
| `docs/訂價重算-Gemini成本-2026-06-28.md` | Gemini Live assumption improves margin but still requires usage calibration | Keep cost assumptions as provisional. Actual model/avatar cost must be measured after live integration. |
| `docs/體檢報告-城堡四方-2026-06-27.md` | B2C uses Apple IAP; RevenueCat is a reasonable first subscription state layer; entitlement service must be multi-source | Keep RevenueCat/StoreKit as provider layer, but Munea backend remains entitlement source of truth. |

Final v1 stance:

```text
Subscription = trust-building base access and predictable care service
Credits = expensive, bursty, optional, or concierge add-on capacity
```

This is more appropriate for an AI health-care companion than a pure game-credit model.

## Current Implementation Status

Implemented now:

- `POST /entitlements` returns the backend-owned subscription state, entitlements, and usage ledger.
- `subscription_ledger` stores plan state, provider, product id, transaction id, renewal, and entitlement JSON.
- `usage_ledger` stores monthly usage by metric.
- `cost_ledger` stores provider/service cost observations for analytics/admin.
- `POST /avatar-session` gates premium Avatar modes and records premium Avatar minutes.
- Local fallback uses `engine/billing_store.json`.

Added as schema foundation:

- `supabase/sql/006_billing_credits_foundation.sql`
- `credit_wallets`
- `credit_ledger`
- `credit_transactions`
- `entitlement_policy_versions`

Not implemented yet:

- App Store Connect products.
- RevenueCat / StoreKit SDK integration.
- Signed App Store Server API or RevenueCat webhook verification.
- Restore purchases UX.
- Runtime credit deduction API.
- Refund/revoke handling for credits.
- Admin console screens for manual adjustment.

## Service Architecture

Paid access should flow through a backend entitlement service:

```text
iOS StoreKit / RevenueCat
  -> verified server event
  -> subscription_ledger
  -> entitlement policy
  -> usage_ledger + credit_wallets
  -> /entitlements response
  -> app feature gates
```

Core rules:

- The frontend can display plan state but cannot grant paid access.
- Subscription and credit state must be account-scoped.
- Family and care-recipient usage can be person-scoped when needed.
- Billing events must not contain raw transcript text.
- Admin changes must write `audit_events`.
- Developer, QA, internal, and demo accounts must be excluded from operating dashboards.

## Plan Shape

Exact quotas and prices are not final. Treat the values below as product-contract placeholders.

| Entitlement | Free | Plus | Premium | Concierge |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Voice companion | limited | yes | yes | yes |
| Routine reminders | basic | yes | yes | yes |
| Family dashboard | limited | expanded | expanded | concierge |
| Family members max | 2 | 4 | 8 | custom/high |
| Long-term memory depth | basic | standard | deeper | highest |
| Reflex model priority | basic | standard | priority | highest practical tier |
| Butler review depth | basic | standard | deeper | concierge review options |
| Real-time premium Avatar | no | limited trial only | yes | yes |
| Premium Avatar minutes | 0 | small/month | monthly grant | large/custom grant |
| Future hardware/service bundle | no | no | optional | primary target |

## Credits Direction

Credits should be used for:

- extra real-time Avatar / GPU minutes beyond monthly allowance.
- high-cost LiveAvatar or Ditto sessions.
- premium media/avatar rendering if added.
- concierge add-ons, hardware/service bundles, or human-supported care operations if added.

Credits should not be used for:

- basic daily companionship.
- normal family dashboard access.
- routine reminders.
- essential safety/referral flows.
- account deletion, data export, or privacy controls.

## Credit Wallet Model

Munea should keep two credit buckets:

| Bucket | Meaning | Expiry | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| included_monthly | monthly plan allowance | expires at period end | predictable cost cap for subscriptions |
| purchased | consumable IAP / paid add-on | no normal expiry | avoids trust and consumer-protection risk |

Implementation rules:

- Keep wallet balances server-side only.
- Use idempotency keys for every grant, consume, refund, and reversal.
- Keep immutable ledger rows instead of editing old credit events.
- Store provider transaction ids, but do not store card data.
- If a subscription is refunded or revoked, reverse unused included credits first and then follow App Store/RevenueCat refund policy for purchased credits.

## Deduction Order

When a paid feature has usage cost:

1. Verify auth and account scope.
2. Load backend entitlement.
3. Check feature-specific allowance in `usage_ledger`.
4. Consume monthly included allowance first.
5. Consume purchased credits only after included allowance is exhausted.
6. If no allowance/credits remain, degrade gracefully.
7. For Avatar, degrade to `2d-viseme`, static face, or voice-only instead of ending the conversation.

No raw transcript text should be stored as part of billing or credit events.

## Backend Source Of Truth

Current source tables:

- `subscription_ledger`
- `usage_ledger`
- `cost_ledger`

Credits foundation tables:

- `credit_wallets`
- `credit_ledger`
- `credit_transactions`
- `entitlement_policy_versions`

Future credit records should include:

- `account_id`
- `person_id` when person-scoped
- `wallet_id`
- `source`: `apple_iap`, `revenuecat`, `promo`, `admin_adjustment`, `refund_reversal`, `b2b_contract`, `included_monthly`
- `direction`: `grant`, `consume`, `expire`, `refund`, `reversal`, `adjustment`
- `amount`
- `balance_after`
- `reason`
- `idempotency_key`
- `provider_transaction_id`
- `created_at`

Every admin adjustment must create an audit event.

## Product Ids

Subscription product ids:

```text
munea.plus.monthly
munea.plus.yearly
munea.premium.monthly
munea.premium.yearly
munea.concierge.monthly
munea.concierge.yearly
```

Consumable credit product ids, if/when credits are added:

```text
munea.credits.small
munea.credits.medium
munea.credits.large
```

Provider mapping can be RevenueCat first, but Munea backend still owns the authoritative entitlement, usage, and credit ledgers.

## API Direction

Current:

- `POST /entitlements`
- `POST /subscription-event`
- `POST /avatar-session`

Next production APIs:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /purchase-restore` | reconcile restored App Store purchase with backend | required |
| `POST /credits/balance` | return wallet balance and safe display summary | required |
| `POST /credits/consume` | server-side credit consumption for costly features | backend/internal |
| `POST /credits/grant` | grant included, promo, or purchased credits | webhook/admin only |
| `POST /credits/refund-reversal` | reverse credits after refund/revoke events | webhook/admin only |

All credit mutations should be server-side only and audit logged.

## Admin And Analytics

Admin MVP must be able to answer:

- Which plan is this account on?
- Which provider granted the entitlement?
- Did the latest App Store/RevenueCat event verify?
- How much voice/avatar usage did the account consume?
- Did the user run out of included allowance or purchased credits?
- Did an admin manually adjust a wallet?
- Are developer/internal/test events excluded from conversion, usage, and North Star metrics?

Recommended Admin modules:

- account subscription lookup.
- credit wallet balance and ledger.
- provider event audit.
- usage/cost summary.
- refund/revoke queue.
- entitlement policy version history.

## App Store And Trust Rules

- Subscription copy must clearly explain what each plan unlocks.
- Restore purchases must be available in app.
- Account deletion must explain what happens to active subscriptions and retained billing records.
- Credits should be described as service credits for premium capacity, not cash, currency, investment value, or gift certificate.
- Purchased credits need legal review before public launch in Taiwan.
- Safety/referral features must not stop working because the user has no credits.

## Implementation Order

1. Lock plan names and entitlement policy. Done.
2. Add credits schema foundation. Done as `006_billing_credits_foundation.sql`.
3. Keep `/entitlements` backend-authoritative. Done for prototype.
4. Implement StoreKit 2 or RevenueCat purchase/restore in Capacitor iOS.
5. Add signed provider event verification and idempotency.
6. Add credit wallet runtime API only when premium Avatar/expensive add-ons are ready.
7. Add Admin MVP views before public App Store launch.

## Open Decisions

- Final price points by market.
- Monthly voice allowance by tier.
- Monthly Avatar minutes by tier.
- Whether Plus includes a tiny Avatar trial or only Premium+.
- Whether Concierge is public self-serve, invitation/application only, or later tied to hardware/service packages.
- RevenueCat Virtual Currency timing versus keeping credits in Munea backend only for v1.
- Taiwan legal wording for purchased credits, refund, expiry, and inactive-account handling.
